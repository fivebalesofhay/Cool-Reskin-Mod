# Cool-Reskin-Mod
A cool reskin mod I made for The Bibites. Just put the provided "CoolReskinMod" folder in the Mods folder. (Note: when you unzip the file, the mod folder will be placed inside another folder, called something like "Cool-Reskin-Mod-main". The folder you want is "CoolReskinMod", without the "main" part.)
